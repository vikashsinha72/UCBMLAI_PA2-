Practical Application III for Comparing Classifiers

# Overview: #
In this practical application assignment, My goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines). I am using the recommended dataset related to bank product marketing over the telephone. Source of the dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

I have used CRISP-DM Methodology to understand and analyze data for comparing the performance of each classifier.

# Understanding the Data #
Extract the .zip file to access the dataset and any accompanying documentation.
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

# Understand the Business Problem:
Objective: The business goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the results of telemarketing campaigns.
This prediction will help the bank target potential customers more effectively.
Data Understanding and Preparation:

# Explore the Dataset: 
Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the features and their relationships.
Handle Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing data.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features into numerical values using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Scaling: Apply feature scaling (e.g., standardization) where necessary, especially for algorithms like SVM and K-Nearest Neighbors.

# Splitting the Data:
Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).


# Modeling with Different Classifiers:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Train each classifier on the training data.

# Model Evaluation:
Accuracy: Evaluate the accuracy of each model on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: Visualize the confusion matrix to understand the performance of each classifier.
Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: Calculate these metrics to gain deeper insights into the models’ performance, especially for imbalanced classes.
ROC Curve and AUC: Plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC score to compare the classifiers’ performance.

# Interpretation of Results:
Compare the performance of the classifiers based on the evaluation metrics.
Discuss which model performs best and why, considering the business context.

# Findings and Actionable Insights:
Present key findings from the analysis.
Provide actionable insights for the marketing team based on the predictive model's performance.

# Next Steps and Recommendations:
Suggest further steps, such as hyperparameter tuning, exploring additional features, or deploying the model into a production environment.
